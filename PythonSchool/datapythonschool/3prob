# Variables in python are very similar to variable in algebra - they can have 
# various values which you can use without actually knowing the value.

# Creating (Declaring) a variable is as simple as  a = 1 which assigns the 
# value of 1 to the variable a.In this case , 'a' is an 'int' (Integer) 
# variable which you can check by executing type(a) 

# Variables can be treated like values , as long as the performed operation 
# exists . For example, you can do a+3 (a is int) but not name-"po" (name
# is a str / string)

# Your task is to set a variable v to 2.5 and print its type.Also print its 
# square.Create another variable animal equal to the string 'foo' and find 
# what animal*3 does and print it.
