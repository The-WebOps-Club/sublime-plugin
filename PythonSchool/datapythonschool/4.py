#Variable can be used defined
#So in order to get the value from user
#we will use raw_input() function
#through the argumet we can ask
#what we need from the user

#When you want to print a variable with a string
#by writing the name of the variable inside
#doesnt print the value of the variable
#There we use format specifiers to print its value
#Format specifiers for
#string is %s
#intger is %d
#relating the variable_name to the format specifiers
#is done through modulo followed by (variable_name)

#For example
#name = "Rohith"
#print("hi %s") % (name)
#Which results in hi Rohith

#The task is ask the user's name,age
#store them in variables
#and print
#Hi user So your age is User's age
