#Another kind of loop is 'for' loop

#``````
#for var in range():
#    block of code comes here
#``````

#var is a variable defined for  
#this variable var is used inside the 
#loop so that it will vary from a given 
#initial number to final like 1-20

#Or it can represent a character in a string
#if the range is replaced by a string or
#a variable representing string

#If that range is replaced by a variable
#that represents list then
#the variable vary from 1st item to 
#to the last item

#for a dictionary you get the key 
#which you can use to get the value

#for loop can be accompanied by a 
#else statement which will be executed only if 
#for loop ends normally,i.e
#if the for loop is stopped by break statement
#then it will not run the else statement

#create a list containing items of fruits : 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape'
#and create a for loop to print 
#you have a fruit_1
#you have a fruit_2
#......
#then at last print this is a good fruit list

#next create another list similar to that 
#including some vegetables as 'banana','apple','tomato','potato','orange','grapes'
#and print the items as said above
#except the last line
