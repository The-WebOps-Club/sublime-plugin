# Python provides many common arithmetic operations.Some of the most basic are :
# addition (+) ,subtraction (-) ,multiplication(*) ,division(/) ,remainder/modulo(%),
# exponentiation(**)
# An example usage would be 3 + 4 , resulting in 7 or 2**3 , resulting in 8

# the order of precedence is ** > *,/,% > +,- but parantheses - ( and ) - can be
# used as in mathematics.

# Your task is to find the product of 23 and 56 and print it , followed by 
# another line with value of 2 raise to power 3 squared
