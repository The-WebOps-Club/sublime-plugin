#instead of using numbers to look
#up for values in a list
#we can use stringd to look up values
#By similarity,that kind of list is list
#is called as Dictionary

#here we use  curly braces({) instead of ([)
#we use string as indexes known as keys
#dict_name = {key1:value1,key2:value2}
#acessing items will be same as list
#use key instead of number

#some functions similar to string functions
#for dictionary are
#dict_name.clear() will give an empty dictionary
#dict_name.copy() will copy the dictionary
#dict_name.has_key(key) will returns true
#if the dict have that key

#create a dictionary named family
#use 4 family members as 'father':'mike','mom':'lilly','bro':'brad','sis':'reena'
#and use their name as their values
#print the value for sis & bro
#create another dict named ages
#and give respective ages of the family members as 'father':44,'mom':39,'bro':24,'sis':19
#check whether it has the key 'kite'
