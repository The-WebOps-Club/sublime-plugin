#there will be situations where we need
#to reuse a peice of code many times
#so instead of rewriting we can define that
#code as a function so that we can use 
#its to call that function anywhere any number of times  

#`````` 
#def func_name(arg1,arg2):
#    peice of code that need to be written many times
#``````

#header includes def keyword and the func. name
#arg1 ,arg2 are the parameters the func requires
#we can return values from the func. using return keyword

#There is something called Modules
#Modules are files containing variables and functions
#that we can use it when imported
#for import a module we use module keyword

#Defina a function named max
#which will take take 3 numbers and 
#return the maximum of the 3
#print the square root the maximum
#using math module
