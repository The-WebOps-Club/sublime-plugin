#Loops allow you to do a block of code multiple times
#while loop is similar to if statement
#while loop will continue to execute as 
#long as the condition is true
#condition should change at some time eventually 
#otherwise it will become a infinite loop

# while condition:
#     block of code or expression comes here
#break statement is used whenever we need to
#go out of the loop

#Task is to print the fibonacci series
#Upto a fibonacci num less than n
