#As u know print command prints only strings enclosed within single(') or double(") quotes 
#So if we try to print a line like 
#Don't look so sad 
#using print('Don't look so sad')
#the interperter will  consider this as 
#one string 'Don'
#and another string started as ') but not ended
#so it will show Syntax Error
#so in order to fix this we use something called Escaping Characters
#In order to tell the interperter to escape the apostrophe
#we put a backslash(/)symbol before which apostrophe u need to escape
#This is applicable for double quotes also
#But if u have both in a same line,dont use blackslash(/),
#instead use triple quotes(""") for enclosing the strings without using (/) anywhere

#The task is to print the line
#Don't you believe that Mike is 6" tall
