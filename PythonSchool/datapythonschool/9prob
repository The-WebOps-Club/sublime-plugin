# sometimes we'd like our code 
#to be able to make decisions
#that is the ability to pick one of the 
#outcomes over the other
#Control flow gives the ability to do that

#for relating 2 things we use comparators listed below
#Equal to (==),Not equal to (!=),Less than (<)
#Less than or equal to (<=),Greater than (>),Greater than or equal to (>=)
#These relations results in either true or false

#if is a conditional statement that executes 
#some specified code after checking if its expression is True
# if condition:
#     here comes the expression(the console will leave some 
#     gap to show that this code is inside the if block)

#the else conditon statement follows an if staement
#which runs when if block doesn't run

#another condition statement is elif
#represents an else if:
#meaning otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this

#ask the user to enter his name
#if no of letters in the name is greater than 7
#print Your name is way too lengthy
#if it is less than 7 print
#your name if way too small
#otherwise print your name is perfect
