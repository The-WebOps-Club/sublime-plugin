#There is another datatype called Lists
#which pretty much what the same as the name suggest
#we can create a list containing data 
#of diff. data types like strings,integer 
#under a same variable name
#A list contains items separated by commas 
#and enclosed within square brackets ([])

#Every list items are numbered/indexed from o to items-1
#and we can access a list item by
#list_name[index]
#u can add/replace any item by
#similar to assigning item to list_name[index]

#Also there is a similar kind of datatype
#called Tuples which is same as lists
#but enclosed within parentheses()
#which can't be updated unlike the lists

#create a list named grocery
#add some 5 items
#create another list named extra
#add 3 items to it
#print the 3rd ite mof grocery
#print the 1st item of extra
#try to add the 2 list and see what happens
