#There is another datatype called Lists
#which pretty much what the same as the name suggest
#we can create a list containing data 
#of diff. data types like strings,integer 
#under a same variable name
#A list contains items separated by commas 
#and enclosed within square brackets ([])

#Every list items are numbered/indexed from o to items-1
#and we can access a list item by
#list_name[index]
#u can add/replace any item by
#similar to assigning item to list_name[index]

#Also there is a similar kind of datatype
#called Tuples which is same as lists
#but enclosed within parentheses()
#which can't be updated unlike the lists

#in lists instead of getting one item
#we can access many items at a time using slicing

#``````
#Get elements from...
#list_name[1:3]  Index 1 through index 3.
#list_name[2:-1] Index 2 through index one from last.
#list_name[:2]   Start through index 2.
#list_name[2:]   Index 2 through end.
#list_name[::2]  Start through end, skipping ahead 2 places each time
